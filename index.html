        <em>Hi </em>everyone, I wanna tell you my story, so back in my
        confusing days of grade 12, I had a hard time what course to take.
        Everybody told me what path should I take. My strand wasn't even in
        the ICT zone, and significant people around me expecting I would
        choose a course related to Filipino Language, Biology or Psychology
        because they always told me that I excel to that subjects. If being
        selfish is a choice, I should have choose Biology but being practical
        weighs more. So others suggested that IT is the best choice since it
        is indemand - you know what I mean.
      </p>
      <p id="sec_indent">
        So, fast forward to my first year in my course or should I say, the
        "What on Earth am I doing here?" program. I have no idea what is
        programming. It was like trying to learn a new language that my brain
        refused to understand. Honestly, when the first time I heard the word
        "coding" it sounded like something robots and aliens did in secret
        societies. My first year was a mix of frustration and questioning why
        I didn't choose a path where Ctrl + Z could undo my decisions. That
        first year was a hundreds of YouTube tutorials, blur of coding,
        debugging, and Googling error messages like a detective trying to
        crack a complicated case. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of
        binary code, desperately trying to stay a<strong>float</strong>, plus
        no one dares to help me with my code so I had to do it on my own. The
        struggles continued into my second year. It was like I was stuck in a
        never-ending loop, constantly debugging my self-doubts and syntax
        errors. I even considered switching courses at one point. Then, I
        questioned my life choices, wondering if my decision to dive into the
        world of IT was a huge mistake. But I remember, the moment Python was
        introduced to us, idk, my heart moved a bit because it's too cute and
        easy to understand. However, there's also a language villain for me
        like C#. Late-night coding sessions turned into early-morning
        existential crises and the only thing that keeps me going was the
        thought that one day, somehow, it would all make sense. Just try to
        graduate and find work and earn money - my very Asian mindset.
      </p>
      <p id="third_indent">
        And now, it's my third year. I know there's a problem when it's been
        three years in my course yet there is unclear vision in me, however, I
        do understand that I don't have a choice. It hurts when I heard people
        say "no choice", silly me coz' I'm using it right now as an excuse. As
        what they say "if the shoe fits, walk in it 'till the high heels
        break" and it's too late now to realize that it's painful... not being
        able to be who you want to be is painful. But I need to invalidate
        that feeling inorder for me to survive. Someone also told us that the
        life when we step in from the real world of IT is much way difficult
        than the struggles in class. I mean, since young, I had experienced
        and exposed to unbearable society, being humiliated, stares of
        judgment, people who tried to bring you down, people who limits you,
        people who tend to support but blocked all exits of hardships, people
        who will abuse your kindness that could turn you into evil and people
        who will manipulate you because they never ended who they want to be.
        I guess it's enivitable. Demo, I don't want to be like them. I want to
        be a person who, despite the imminent hardships, retains integrity and
        authenticity burns within me. I don't want to succumb to the
        negativity that surrounds me. The challenges may be unavoidable, but
        the way I respond to them is within my control. This third year is not
        just about navigating the complexities of algorithms and programming
        languages; it's about fortifying my character and sense of self within
        the dynamic IT landscape. As I stare at lines of code, I am reminded
        that, like them, I have the power to adapt, grow, and create something
        meaningful. The challenges may be fated, but they are also an integral
        part of the journey toward becoming a resilient, authentic individual
        in the vast and ever-changing world of IT.
